  <!-- Despite the fact that this is the login page, I believe there is
  still value in adding the csrf token in this form as this can prevent
  attackers from using CSRF to login into an account. Although I cannot
  think of a way this could be abused, I believe it is better to be
  safe, in case attackers are more creative than me. I am aware there are
  scenarios in which this can inconvenience legitimate users, they need only
  refresh the token if it expires to proceed normally. -->
